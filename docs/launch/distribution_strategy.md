Subject: Free AI writing tool that might interest your audience

Hi [Name],

I've been following your content on [specific topic] and really appreciate your insights on [specific example].

I've built a Chrome extension called Writers Block that helps people write better using AI. It's like having a writing coach that works on any website - Gmail, LinkedIn, Google Docs, etc.

The unique feature is custom writing styles - users can create their own AI prompts for specific tones or formats they use regularly.

Would you be interested in trying it out? I'd love to get your feedback, and if you find it valuable, perhaps you'd consider sharing it with your audience.

No pressure at all - I know you get lots of these requests!

Best,
[Your name]
