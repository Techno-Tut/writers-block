# Product Spec

It is a writer assists chrome extension based agent that can help

1. Review documents
2. Get Tone and analysis and understand any gaps
3. Give suggestion and edit specific section of the document instead of replacing or rewriting the whole text which could make it tough for human to review in a text editor

**Pilot Support**: Initial implementation targets Salesforce Quip documents

## Feature 1: Text Selection & AI Processing:
User selects text and gets a hover UI with an input field and few prepopulated options like rephrase, etc.

### UI Behavior:
- Hover UI appears with 0.5 second delay after text selection
- Positions below or above the selection (wherever there is space)
- Closes when user deselects text or clicks anywhere else
- If user selects new text while UI is open, it updates with the new selection

### Core Actions:
- **Grammar & Spelling Fix**: Immediately triggers agent to correct grammatical errors and spelling mistakes
- **Rephrase**: Provides tone selection (Professional, Casual, Academic, Creative, Technical) for contextual rephrasing
- **Custom Rewrite**: User-defined rewrite styles with personalized prompts (see Feature 3)

### Text Replacement System:
- **Reliable Integration**: Uses `document.execCommand('insertText')` for maximum compatibility with web editors
- **Selection Preservation**: Stores and restores text selection ranges to handle UI interactions
- **Undo Support**: Maintains browser's native undo/redo functionality (Ctrl+Z/Cmd+Z)
- **Apply/Cancel Flow**: Shows original vs processed text comparison with clear action buttons
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation messages with auto-close functionality

### Chat Interface Design:
- **Visual Style**: Glassmorphism/translucent design with backdrop blur effect
- **Initial State**: Compact floating window (280px wide) with semi-transparent background
- **Chat Mode**: Expands vertically when user types custom prompts (max 400px height)
- **Tool Call Confirmation**: When agent suggests text replacement, shows:
  - Agent message explaining the action
  - Preview box with new text (glass effect with subtle border)
  - [Apply] [Refine] [Cancel] buttons with glass styling
- **Post-Action**: Shows brief summary after successful application, then auto-collapses
- **Scrolling**: For longer conversations within max height limit
- **Glass Effects**: 
  - Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
  - Subtle borders and shadows
  - Maintains readability while blending with document background

### Agent Context & Analysis:
- **Document Context**: Agent reads the complete Quip document to understand overall tone, style, and context
- **Tone Matching**: Automatically matches the document's existing tone when rephrasing or making changes
- **Contextual Processing**: Uses surrounding text and Quip document structure to make appropriate suggestions
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensures all changes align with the document's writing style and voice
- **Quip Integration**: Leverages Quip's contenteditable structure and auto-save mechanisms

### User Flow:
User selects text and agent analyzes both the selection and complete document context. Agent can do analysis on top and return back action. In case of tool call for replacing the text, the user confirms in UI and replaces the selected text with the new text.

## Feature 2: Deep Research Agent (To Be Discussed - Not for MVP):
**Status**: Future feature requiring clarification and detailed specification

### Concept Overview:
Extends core text processing capabilities to include research capabilities for enhancing selected text with external information and data sources.

### Areas Requiring Discussion:
- **Research Sources**: What external data sources to integrate (web search, academic databases, company knowledge bases)
- **Research Scope**: How much context and depth of research to provide
- **Information Integration**: How to seamlessly blend research findings with selected text
- **Fact Verification**: Ensuring accuracy and reliability of research information
- **User Control**: How users specify research parameters and preferences
- **Performance**: Balancing research depth with response time
- **Cost Implications**: External API costs for research capabilities

### Placeholder for Future Specification:
This feature will be fully specified after MVP completion and user feedback on core functionality.

## Feature 3: Conversational Chat Interface:
Transform single-interaction model into conversational AI writing assistant.

### Chat Capabilities:
- **Message History**: Persistent conversation during session with message bubbles
- **Follow-up Interactions**: Users can refine, modify, or ask follow-up questions about text changes
- **Context Preservation**: AI maintains context of previous interactions and text selections
- **Multiple Suggestions**: Users can request different approaches to the same text
- **Inline Apply**: Apply buttons on individual AI messages containing text changes

### Chat Flow:
1. **Initial Selection**: User selects text ‚Üí Chat window appears with context
2. **AI Processing**: User chooses action ‚Üí AI responds in chat bubble format
3. **Conversation**: User can continue with "Make it more formal", "Add more detail", etc.
4. **Selective Application**: Apply specific AI suggestions while continuing conversation
5. **Session Persistence**: Chat history maintained until window is closed

### Technical Implementation:
- **Message Storage**: Local storage for conversation persistence
